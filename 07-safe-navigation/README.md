# Safe Navigation Operator

```javascript

<div class="children">Children:{{ passenger.children?.length }}</div>

```

The expression above will be evaluated and passenger.children will be checked for a value.
Having a safe navigation operator allows use to essentially safety check our object properties before they are parsed.
